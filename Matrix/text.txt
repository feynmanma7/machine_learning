One year? Dude (or dudette)â€¦

There are many great companies. You might be really happy at Google. Or maybe there's a better company for you. Google is not the be-all-and-end-all of companies. It is not the pinnacle of success.

And if you spend all your free time coding, you're going to probably be miserable and burnt out. Chasing this dream of yours by getting narrowly focused on one company and spending all your time on it will probably not lead to success there.

Chill. Relax.

Spend some of your free time on coding stuff. Not all. Not even most.

Of that free time, make yourself a better engineer. Learning data structure and algorithms is only a small piece of that.
